Features
Clean HTML Structure: Easy-to-understand and well-commented HTML for the ticket layout.
CSS Styling: Basic styling to mimic the appearance of a physical receipt (e.g., monospace font, dashed lines, aligned totals).
Itemized List: Clearly displays quantities, item descriptions, and prices.
Dynamic Content Placeholder: Designed to be easily integrated with backend data (e.g., a database of orders).
Print-Friendly (Basic): Can be printed directly from a browser, though further print-specific CSS would enhance this.
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
You only need a modern web browser to view this HTML file. No special software or servers are required.

Usage
Clone the repository (optional) or download the file:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-ticket.git
cd restaurant-ticket
(Replace your-username/restaurant-ticket.git with your actual repository URL if you host this on GitHub).
Alternatively, simply copy the HTML content into a file named index.html (or any other .html name).

Open the index.html file:
Navigate to the saved HTML file on your computer and open it with your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

You should see the styled restaurant ticket displayed in your browser.

Customization
You can easily customize the ticket to fit your specific needs:

Restaurant Details: Edit the text within the <div class="ticket-header"> to change the restaurant name, address, phone, and order information.
Menu Items: Modify the <tbody> section of the <table> within <div class="order-details">. Add, remove, or change the <tr> elements to update the ordered items.
<td> elements correspond to Quantity, Item Description, and Price.
Totals: Adjust the values in <div class="totals"> for subtotal, tax, and total. For a real application, these would be calculated dynamically.
Styling: The <style> block in the <head> section contains all the CSS. You can modify font sizes, colors, spacing, borders, and more to match your brand's aesthetic.
